<h2>Structure</h2>
    	<h3>Body</h3>
    		<p> The body of the webpage houses all of the content that is intended to be displayed to the public. The browser renders everything enclosed within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags so that it is viewable. All other tags that we learn about go inside the body of the document. </p>

<h3>Tags Used Within the Body</h3>
    	
    	<h4>Div tag</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a generic container that is used when none of the other tags appropriately define the information contained. They are used more often than not with CSS.</p>

<h4>Section</h4>
    		<p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag is used to group like content together. Sections could be nested or stand alone. Usually, the sections contain headers and footers. 
       	 
       	 <h4>Article</h4>
			<p> The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is used for grouped information within sections. These are usually not nested unless they are nested within sections of other sections [aside: to see more about nesting, go to Nesting].
			
    	<h4>Paragraph</h4>
   			<p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is probably the most common tag you will see in a document, simply because it defines the portion of text that should be displayed as a paragraph. It is possible for a very simple page to be composed simply of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code><code> &lt;/p&gt;</code> elements, however, it is very limited and it doesn't tell you much about the information enclosed. Also, when we start to style the page using CSS, other tags, such as section and article help better define parts of the webpage.</p>
   	 	
   		<h4>Navigation</h4>
   			<p> The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/nav&gt;</code> tag groups navigation links together. These links are usually presented as an unordered list (see below). [to see more about links go to Links and Images].

   		<h4>Footer</h4>
    		<p> The footer comes at the end of a section or the page with extra information. </p>
 
 </article>


    <h4>Details</h4>
      <h2>Your Turn</h2>
   <p>Now that you have all of the elements you need to create the head of a page, give it a try</p>
   <ul>
   <li>What should the title of your personal profile be?</li>
   <li>What meta information would you like to include?</li>
   <li>Are there any comments or notes you would like to make for yourself or others to help you remember anything?</li>
   </ul>
