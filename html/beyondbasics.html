    <h4>Aside</h4>
    <p> The aside tags <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/aside&gt;</code> are used for pieces of content that relate to an article or webpage's content but could stand on its own or may not be necessary to understand the rest of the content. Asides could be presented in various ways. They are used much like sidebars are used in print documents, though in websites, they don't necessarily have to be sidebars. Another example would be of a pull quote from a long article that highlights the topic, or glossary of terminology, or related links for further information.  In this guide, you see examples of how they are used to present extra information. </p>
