      <p class="lead">Want to try out Sass for yourself? Follow these steps:</p>


      <ol>
        <li>
          Install Ruby on your computer. Ruby has several different versions available, but if you only need it to
          use Sass, then just select the most recent stable version.
          <ul>
            <li>Have a Mac running OSX? Good news: you already have it. Skip to the next step.</li>
            <li>Have Windows? Use the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RailsInstaller</a>.</li>
            <li>Have Linux? You probably already know what you're doing, but here's <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">some information</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Install the Sass code package (called a "gem").
<pre>
gem install sass
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Technically, you could start using Sass after this step, but since you've already taken the time to
          install/configure Ruby, you should also install the Compass gem. Compass is a way to automate the conversion of .scss files
           to .css files. It's definitely worth the extra step.
<pre>
gem install compass
</pre
        </li>

        <li>
          If you already have project in place, 
        </li>
      </ol>
